# Blackjack
In this project I made a very basic Blackjack game with an intermediate OOP knowledge and the Python Programming Language.
In this game, you play against the dealer. You are both dealt hands and you can Hit or Stay based on the knowledge of your cards and the one card you can see of the dealers.
